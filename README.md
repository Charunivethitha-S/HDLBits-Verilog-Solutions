# HDLBits-Verilog-Solutions

This repository contains complete and systematically organized solutions to HDLBits, implemented using Verilog HDL. HDLBits is a well-recognized platform for strengthening  core digital design concepts, Verilog language constructs, circuit implementations, and simulation-based verification techniques. Each design is verified within HDLBits and follows clean, synthesizable RTL coding practices, making this repository a professional reference for students and beginners in digital electronics and VLSI design.
